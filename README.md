There are for web pages which have been designed and developed for the website. The website is about my E-Portfilio where I have 
outlined information about myself and the skills I have learned throghout my study period of five years at South and City College
which progressed onto De Montford University.
I have added images and the naviagtion bar is fully navigated. The website is fully responsive where I have implemented the code in CSS. 
I have added flex to the contact page as it worked well with that page although I did try to implement it in the portfolio page first.
