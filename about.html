      <h3><font color = "#8B0000">I started my studies at South and City College where I completed my Extended Diploma in Computing Level 2.<br>
         I then progressed onto Higher National Diploma at level    3. After completing all the units sccessfully, achieving a Distinction for that level, I was given a place at the same college for degree at a Higher National Certificate level 4 and Higher National Diploma level 5. I have completed both levels successfully achieving a Merit.<br>
         <br>
         <br>
         In my final year I was granted a place at De Montford University. I have successfully completed all the units achieving good grades. The most interesting units i have found is completing my final year project where i had to research on machine learning techniques and have completed the analysis and the project using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. This was particularly interesting as the tools and techniques were pretty fascinating in exploring and I found it amusing seeing the results generated on the Graphical User Interface. <br>
         <br>
        But... I want to start my journey in the world of Web Development!</font>
